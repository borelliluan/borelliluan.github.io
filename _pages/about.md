I am an incoming PhD student in UC Berkeley's [Department of Economics](https://econ.berkeley.edu/). I received my MA in Economics from the [Brazilian School of Economics and Finance – FGV EPGE](https://epge.fgv.br/), and my BA from the [Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets – Ibmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibmec).

Previously, I was a predoctoral research assistant under the supervision of [Marcelo Moreira](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/), working alongside professors [Mahrad Sharifvaghefi](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/) and [Whitney Newey](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/whitney-newey), and a research assistant at the National Development Research Program of the [Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx), Brazil's government counterpart to the [NBER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research). At Ipea, I served in the Directorate of Macroeconomic Studies and Policies (DIMAC), focusing on applied econometric and macroeconomic modeling. I also contributed to the [Ipeadata](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx) project by developing an API wrapper—now featured on Ipea's official website—that has become a widely used public resource. This wrapper, named [IpeadataPy](https://github.com/luanborelli/ipeadatapy), allows users to extract data from Ipeadata—a database containing financial, demographic, geographic, and social indicators managed by Ipea—directly through Python code. IpeadataPy has since accumulated over [250,000 downloads](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ipeadatapy) and continues to be actively maintained by me.

My current research focuses on econometrics, with a particular emphasis on identification.
