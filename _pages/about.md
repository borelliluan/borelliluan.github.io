I am a PhD student in UC Berkeley's [Department of Economics](https://econ.berkeley.edu/).

Previously, I was a predoctoral research assistant under the supervision of [Marcelo Moreira](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/), working alongside professors [Mahrad Sharifvaghefi](https://sites.google.com/view/mahrad) and [Whitney Newey](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/whitney-newey), and a research assistant at the National Development Research Program of the [Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx)—Brazil’s government counterpart to the [NBER](https://www.nber.org/). 

As a predoctoral research assistant, I worked on open problems involving the computation of continuously updating GMM estimators (CUE) in the presence of heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors, as well as on estimation and inference under alternative, many-moment asymptotics.

At Ipea, I served in the Directorate of Macroeconomic Studies and Policies, focusing on applied econometric and macroeconomic research. I also contributed to the [Ipeadata](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx) project by developing an API wrapper called [IpeadataPy](https://github.com/luanborelli/ipeadatapy), which has become a widely used public resource. IpeadataPy has since accumulated over [250,000 downloads](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ipeadatapy).

My current research focuses on econometrics, with an emphasis on identification.
