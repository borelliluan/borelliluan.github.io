I am an economist with an MA degree from [FGV EPGE – Brazilian School of Economics and Finance](), and a BA from the [Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (IBMEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibmec). Currently, I am a 
predoctoral research assistant under the supervision of [Marcelo Moreira](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/), working alongside professors [Mahrad Sharifvaghefi](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/) and [Whitney Newey](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/whitney-newey). 

Formerly, I worked as a research assistant at the National Development Research Program of the [Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx), Brazil's equivalent of the NBER, serving in the Directorate of Macroeconomic Studies and Policies (DIMAC) with a focus on applied statistical and macroeconomic modeling. I also worked on the [Ipeadata](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx) project developing an API, now featured on Ipea's official website, that has become a widely used public resource. This API, named [IpeadataPy](https://github.com/luanborelli/ipeadatapy), allows users to extract data from Ipeadata---a database containing financial, demographic, geographic, and social data managed by Ipea---directly through Python code. IpeadataPy has since accumulated over [210,000 downloads](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ipeadatapy) and remains actively maintained by me.

So far I have written and published for important institutions, among which nationally one can mention, in addition to Ipea, the National School of Public Administration (ENAP) and the Valor Econômico newspaper; and internationally the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and its public policy portal, VoxEU. My current research interests are focused on Econometrics, with a focus on identification, estimation, and inference in the context of moment restrictions models.
