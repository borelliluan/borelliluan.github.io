I am an incoming PhD student in UC Berkeley's [Department of Economics](https://econ.berkeley.edu/).

Previously, I was a predoctoral research assistant under the supervision of [Marcelo Moreira](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/), working alongside professors [Mahrad Sharifvaghefi](https://sites.google.com/site/moreiramarceloj/) and [Whitney Newey](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/whitney-newey), and a research assistant at the National Development Research Program of the [Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx)—Brazil’s government counterpart to the NBER. 

As a predoctoral research assistant, I worked on open problems involving the computation of continuously updating estimators (CUE) in the presence of heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors, as well as on estimation and inference under alternative, many-moment asymptotics.

At Ipea, I served in the Directorate of Macroeconomic Studies and Policies (DIMAC), focusing on applied econometric and macroeconomic research. I also contributed to the [Ipeadata](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx) project by developing an API wrapper that has become a widely used public resource. This wrapper, named [IpeadataPy](https://github.com/luanborelli/ipeadatapy), allows users to extract data from Ipeadata—a comprehensive database containing financial, demographic, geographic, and social indicators managed by Ipea—directly via Python code. IpeadataPy has since accumulated over [250,000 downloads](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ipeadatapy) and continues to be actively maintained by me.

My current research focuses on econometrics, with an emphasis on identification.
