abstract = {We applied the SIR-macro model proposed by Eichenbaum et al. (2020) in its complete version to comparatively study the interaction between economic decisions and COVID-19 epidemics in five different Brazilian states: São Paulo (SP), Amazonas (AM), Ceará (CE), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Pernambuco (PE). Our goal was to analyze qualitatively how the main intrinsic differences of each of these states could affect the epidemic dynamics and its consequences. We computed and compared the model for each of the states, both in competitive equilibrium and under optimal containment policy adoption, and analyzed the implications of optimal policy adoption. We concluded that the intrinsic characteristics of the five different states could imply relevant differences in the general dynamics of the epidemic, in the optimal containment policies, in the effect of the adoption of these policies, and the severity of the economic recessions. One year after the original ex-ante calibration, we evaluated the death toll and economic recession predicted by the model comparing it against real data. The model predictions showed to be qualitatively sufficient to anticipate the size of the pandemic risk that later materialized in Brazil.}

  title={Forecasting Brazilian GDP under Fiscal Foresight and Nonfundamentalness with a Noncausal Fiscal VAR},
  author={Borelli, Luan and Vonbun, Christian},
  year={2024},
  journal={Forthcoming in Brazilian Review of Econometrics},
  abstract={Due to the occurrence of fiscal foresight, conventional fiscal VAR models are naturally inclined to suffer from the phenomena of nonfundamentalness and noncausality, which may imply biased estimates. These problems have been widely identified in the fiscal literature, however until recently disregarded in most of the Brazilian fiscal VAR research. In order to fill this gap, we estimate a noncausal fiscal VAR model for Brazil—which addresses the misspecification arising from these problems—and use it to forecast Brazilian GDP. The results indicate that the noncausal VAR has better forecasting performance than the conventional purely causal VAR, when considering the ``typical'' Brazilian fiscal VAR dataset. This suggests that fiscal expectations have a crucial role in determining the dynamics of Brazilian GDP.}
